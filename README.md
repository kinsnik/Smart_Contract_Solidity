# **Smart_Contract_Solidity**

This purpose of this project is to automate the creation of joint savings accounts by  creating a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. The smart contract will use ether/wei management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

## **Technologies**

This program is written in Solidity using Remix IDE.  

To run this you will need to open the joint_accounts.sol file in Remix.etherium.org which will lead to a Remix IDE screen.  

You can open the joint_accounts.sol file in that system to make deposits and withdrawls.
